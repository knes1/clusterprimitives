clusterprimitives
=================

Library that adds a set of cluster programming primitives to Spring Framework

## Goal

Provide high level clustering primitives that are easy to use, naturally integrate into Spring Framework, and solve some of the typical cluster related problems. Library is intended to be an abstraction layer over implementations such as JGroups or Apache ZooKeeper.

Currently, only leader election via JGroups is provided.
